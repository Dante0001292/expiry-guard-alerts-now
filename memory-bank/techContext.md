# Tech Context: ExpiryGuard

## Technologies Used
- **React** (with functional components and hooks)
- **React Router** for SPA navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Lucide-react** for icons
- **React Query** (planned/partial) for async data

## Development Setup
- Project structure: `/src` for all app code, `/components` for UI, `/pages` for routes
- Uses Vite or Create React App (assumed from structure)
- Memory Bank for documentation in `/memory-bank`
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript (assumed, check for .ts/.tsx)

## Technical Constraints
- Must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- Accessibility and semantic HTML are priorities
- Designed for easy future integration with backend APIs and third-party services

## Dependencies
- `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`
- `tailwindcss`, `lucide-react`
- (Planned) `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching
