# Product Context: ExpiryGuard

## Why ExpiryGuard Exists
ExpiryGuard was created to address the costly problem of expired inventory in retail, pharmacy, and food businesses. Manual tracking is error-prone and time-consuming, leading to waste, compliance risks, and lost revenue.

## Problems Solved
- Missed or late identification of expiring products
- Inefficient manual inventory checks
- Lack of actionable insights for inventory optimization
- Difficulty in enforcing FEFO/FIFO and discounting policies
- Poor user experience with legacy systems

## How It Should Work
- Users add/manage products and their expiry dates in a modern dashboard
- The system automatically tracks expiry and sends timely alerts (30/60/90 days, etc.)
- FEFO/FIFO logic helps prioritize sales of soon-to-expire items
- Discount rules can be set for products nearing expiry
- Analytics and reports provide insights into waste, savings, and compliance
- All features are accessible via a responsive, intuitive UI

## User Experience Goals
- Fast onboarding and easy navigation
- Clear, actionable notifications
- Mobile-friendly and accessible design
- Seamless integration with existing workflows
- Trustworthy, secure, and reliable operation
