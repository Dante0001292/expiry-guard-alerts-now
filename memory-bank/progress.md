# Progress: ExpiryGuard

## What Works
- Landing page, navigation, and footer (with contact form removed)
- Authentication pages (Sign In, Sign Up)
- Dashboard and main sections: Inventory, Products, Expiry Calendar
- Placeholder pages for Categories, Reports, Users, and Settings
- Routing for all main and dashboard pages
- Memory Bank documentation is up to date

## What's Left to Build
- Sidebar/dashboard navigation links to new pages
- Core features for Categories, Reports, Users, and Settings
- Backend/API integration for inventory, users, and analytics
- Advanced alerting, discounting, and analytics logic
- Integrations with POS/e-commerce platforms

## Current Status
- Project is scaffolded and ready for feature development
- UI/UX is modern and responsive
- Documentation and context are well maintained

## Known Issues
- Dashboard navigation/sidebar does not yet link to new pages
- No backend/API integration yet
- Some CTAs (e.g., in hero, pricing) may still lack navigation
